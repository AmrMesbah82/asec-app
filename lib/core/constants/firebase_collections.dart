/// File Name: firebase_collections.dart
/// Purpose: Single source of truth for Firestore collection, field and Storage
///          folder names.
/// Author: ASEC team
/// Created: 19/9/2026
///
/// Never type a collection name at a call site. A name typed inline is a name
/// that eventually drifts — `quiz_attempts` in one screen and `attempts` in
/// another, and one of them quietly reads nothing.
///
/// Layout is FLAT and top-level:
///
///   users/{uid}                 every account (the one admin + the members)
///   videos/{id}                 a lesson video in Cloud Storage
///   quizzes/{id}                title, timer, window and the questions
///   attempts/{quizId}_{uid}     one member's answers and score for one quiz
///   notifications/{id}          texts the admin sends (the bell)
///   tips/{id}                   tips & tricks (home-page pop-up, saved_by[])
///   library/{id}                files in the member Library
///   course_files/{id}           folders + files inside a course
///   course_settings/{id}        per-course switches (watch in order)
///   progress/{uid}              a member's watch progress → stars
