/// The one placeholder colour every dropdown in the app uses.
///
/// ADDED 19/8/2026 — the hint colour used to be whatever a caller happened to
/// pass in `hintStyle`, and the three dropdowns disagreed about the default:
/// `AppColors.text.withOpacity(0.4)` here and on the range calendar, plain
/// `AppColors.secondaryText` on the date calendar. Two of those sitting on one
/// row showed two different greys.
///
/// It is NOT a parameter any more. `hintStyle` still owns size, weight and
/// family — the colour is reapplied on top of whatever the caller passes, so
/// `hintStyle: ....copyWith(color: Colors.red)` is silently ignored rather
/// than allowed to drift. Both calendar dropdowns import this rather than
/// keeping a copy, which is what let them drift in the first place.
///
/// A getter, not a `const`: `AppColors.secondaryText` resolves against the
/// active theme, so this has to be read at build time.
Color get kDropdownHintColor => AppColors.secondaryText.withOpacity(0.5);

/// Vertical gap between a field's label and the field itself.
///
/// ADDED 29/8/2026. Three controls that routinely stand side by side in one row
/// each had their own idea of this gap — `CustomDropdown` used 3,
/// `CustomDropdownCalendar` used 6, and screens that hand-roll a labelled box
/// (Adding New Access) used 8. Since the gap sits ABOVE the field, a different
/// gap means the FIELDS start at different heights: a row of three read as
/// stepped rather than aligned, and no amount of matching the field heights
/// fixed it.
///
/// Raw, not `.sp`: callers apply `.sp` at the point of use, so a value that has
/// already been scaled is never scaled twice.

/// number — that is the whole point of it being here.

    // `height:` is the parameter that means "size the trigger" (see `_sized`),

    // `Flexible(fit: loose)` and not `Expanded`: loose means the trigger keeps
    // its natural height whenever there is room for it, and only gives ground
    // when there is not. `Expanded` would force it to fill, so a dropdown
    // sitting in a tall Row (bounded, but with height to spare) would stretch
    // to the full row — a regression the striped overflow would have hidden.
