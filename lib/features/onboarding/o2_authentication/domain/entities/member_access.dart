/// File Name: member_access.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `MemberAccess` — whether a MEMBER may use the app right
///          now, on this device: the admin's per-member settings (devices,
///          access period, pause) checked against the clock and the
///          platform the app is running on. Which COURSES they see is
///          `AppUser.canSeeCourse`.
/// Author: ASEC team
/// Created: 1/10/2026
/// Updated: 23/10/2026 - Signing in is no longer limited by platform or
///          device: a member may use the app on any number of devices and
///          platforms. The platforms now limit only the courses (videos,
///          video quizzes, certificates) — see `AppUser.canSeeCourse`.
